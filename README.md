# holbertonschool-binary_trees


A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each parent node can have at most two children. 
The top node is called the root, and nodes in the tree have parent-child relationships. Each node of a binary tree consists of three items: data item / address of left child / address of right child.  

Binary trees are used for various purposes in computer science, including efficient searching (in the case of Binary Search Trees), representing mathematical expressions, implementing priority queues, and more.

## Requierments
